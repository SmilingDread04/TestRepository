//Unity has a variety of scaling proportions depending on how you want players to see the game, which is changeable from the Game Display.
//Listed down below are the (rough) estimations I tested when using their Ascpect Ratios.

//5 by 4: 12.5 x 10
//4 by 3: 13.3 x 10
//3 by 2: 14.95 x 10
//16 by 10: 16 x 10
//16 by 9: 17.8 x 10
//Standalone (1024 x 768): 13.3 x 10
