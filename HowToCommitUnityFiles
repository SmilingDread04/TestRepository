// To start uploading files for a game, a Unity Project must be made.  To do so, click the app icon.
// Before you can use the actual app, a Product Plan must have been chosen.  Many options exist, but for testing, use Unity Personal.
// Once you've followed Unity's process for downloading (if you don't have the app), click on the "New" button at the top right corner.
// Name the project whatever you want, and click either 3D or 2D for the game you want to create (This will be based on 3D instructions).
// Click the ... on the "Location" button and click the Repository you cloned from GitKraken (see "HowToUseGitKraken" for more details).
// Press the light blue "Create a Project" button to create a new project.
// With the .gitignore file that was created at the beginning, you should be only getting 16 files for upstaging.
// For the record, all these files will be listed as (Name of Repository)/ProjectSettings/(File's Name).asset, just to save on time.
// If this doesn't work, and you get over 100 of these files, here's what you need to stage:
// AudioManager, ClusterInputManager, DynamicsManager, EditorBuildSettings, EditorSettings GraphicsSettings, InputManager, NavMeshAreas...
// ...NetworkManager, Physics2DSettings, ProjectSettings, ProjectVersion, QualitySettings, TagManager, TimeManager, & UnityConnectSettings
